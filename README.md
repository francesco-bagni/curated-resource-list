# Resources

This is a list of categorised resources for the sustainable energy sector. Some notes:

- The list started for research while applying for grant in the UK so most resources make sense for this market.
- We are focusing on electricity data exchange, so most of the resources see the problem from this point of view.
- Categories have grown organically with content, they don't follow a specific taxonomy and are subject to change.
