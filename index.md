# Resources

This is a list of categorised resources for the sustainable energy sector. Some notes:

- The list started for research while applying for grant in the UK so most resources make sense for this market.
- We are focusing on electricity data exchange, so most of the resources see the problem from this point of view.
- Categories have grown organically with content, they don't follow a specific taxonomy and are subject to change.

it has been organised in the following sections:

- [business](./business.html): VCs, funds, accelerators, public funding, investments, etc.
- [companies](./companies.html): consultancies, organisations, media, activism, carbon offset, meteo forecast, market compare, energy, etc.
- [hardware](./hardware.html): IoT, thermostats, energy monitors, sensors, electrical storage, photovoltaic, microgrid, etc.
- [knowledge](./knowledge.html): general information, energy consumption, technologies, business, etc.
- [questions](./q.html) for a path to decarbonisation
- [software](./software.html): DSR management, building performance and monitoring, blockchains, AI and management solutions, etc.
