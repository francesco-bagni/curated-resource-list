## Standards

This section is embarrassingly short, but reflects quite well the reality of things: there are very few standards around, with most of the platforms using proprietary solutions.

- [ISO 50001](https://www.iso.org/iso-50001-energy-management.html) supports organizations in all sectors to use energy more efficiently, through the development of an energy management system
- [SMETS2](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/smart-metering-equipment-technical-specifications-second-version) smart meter specs v2 adopted by UK
- [IEEE P825](https://standards.ieee.org/project/825.html) - Guide for Interoperability of Transactive Energy Systems with Electric Power Infrastructure
- [European Energy Flexibility Platform and Interface (EF-PI)](https://flexible-energy.eu/) - [link docs](http://fpai-ci.sensorlab.tno.nl/builds/fpai-documentation/development/html/) not really a standard, more a consortium of private companies trying to adopt a common toolset.

## Subsidies / regulations / certifications

- [TERRE](https://consultations.entsoe.eu/markets/terre/) is the Trans European Replacement Reserves Exchange. From what I understood companies like Flexitricity or any other PPA can use this protocol to provide demand side response with a 15' cycle time. have no idea how they implement it though.
- Green deal (expired 2014) [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Deal)[link](https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures)
- energy performance certificate (private residence only?) [EPC register](https://www.epcregister.com/reportSearchAddressTerms.html) there’s also a data set here: [London domestic efficiency by boroughs](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/domestic-energy-efficiency-ratings-borough)
- [microgeneration](https://www.microgenerationcertification.org/) quality certification supported by BEIS
- [stroma certification](https://www.stroma.com/certification/) for epc, gas, etc...
- [BREEAM](https://www.breeam.com/) world’s leading sustainability assessment method + certification for masterplanning projects, infrastructure and buildings.

## Data sets and APIs

- [Electric Insights](https://electricinsights.co.uk) was established by Drax Group to help inform and enlighten the debate on Britain’s electricity.
- [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/) the US Energy Information Administration has done a comprehensive survey of commercial buildings with their energy consumption
- [ENERGYDATA.INFO](https://energydata.info/) is an open data platform providing access to datasets and data analytics that are relevant to the energy sector.
- [Elexon](https://www.elexon.co.uk/) meters data harvesting and comparison, balancing and settlement code (bsc), **lots and lots of data!** They also have an API, check this out [link](https://www.elexon.co.uk/new-balancing-mechanism-reporting-service-bmrs/)
- Data sets [for the US](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=energy-consumption#sec-tags) (commercial and residential hourly load profile linked here - [link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/commercial-and-residential-hourly-load-profiles-for-all-tmy3-locations-in-the-united-state))
- energy consumption UK data set [link](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/26afb14b-be9a-4722-916e-10655d0edc38/energy-consumption-in-the-uk)
- 5.5k households smart meter half hour readings between nov 11 and feb 14 [link](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households)
- [UK-DALE](http://jack-kelly.com/data/) domestic appliance-level electricity demand and whole-house demand from five UK homes. [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20157)
- [REDD](http://redd.csail.mit.edu/): The Reference Energy Disaggregation Data Set at MIT. Paper: A public data set for energy disaggregation research. In proceedings of the SustKDD workshop on Data Mining Applications in Sustainability, 2011. [PDF](http://redd.csail.mit.edu/kolter-kddsust11.pdf)
- [DRED](http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/akshay/dred/) (Dutch Residential Energy Dataset) is the first open-access, publicly available dataset from The Netherlands. The data set live deployment consists of several sensors measuring electricity, occupants occupancy and ambient parameters in a household.
