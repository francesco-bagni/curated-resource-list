# Standards, certifications, regulations

[back to the index](./)

## Standards or widely adopted protocols and formats

This section is embarrassingly short, but reflects quite well the reality of things: there are very few standards around, with most of the platforms using proprietary solutions.

- [ISO 50001](https://www.iso.org/iso-50001-energy-management.html) supports organizations in all sectors to use energy more efficiently, through the development of an energy management system
- [SMETS2](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/smart-metering-equipment-technical-specifications-second-version) smart meter specs v2 adopted by UK
- [IEEE P825](https://standards.ieee.org/project/825.html) - Guide for Interoperability of Transactive Energy Systems with Electric Power Infrastructure
- [European Energy Flexibility Platform and Interface (EF-PI)](https://flexible-energy.eu/) - [link docs](http://fpai-ci.sensorlab.tno.nl/builds/fpai-documentation/development/html/) not really a standard, more a consortium of private companies trying to adopt a common toolset.
- [Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/) is an open source initiative to streamline working with data from the Internet of Things. Haystack standardize semantic data models and web services with the goal of making it easier to unlock value from the vast quantity of data being generated by the smart devices
- [KNX](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/index.php) develop and promote the KNX standard so that it is recognised as the basis for creating Smart home and building solutions

## Subsidies / regulations / certifications

- [TERRE](https://consultations.entsoe.eu/markets/terre/) is the Trans European Replacement Reserves Exchange. From what I understood companies like Flexitricity or any other PPA can use this protocol to provide demand side response with a 15' cycle time. have no idea how they implement it though.
- Green deal (expired 2014) [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Deal)[link](https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures)
- energy performance certificate (private residence only?) [EPC register](https://www.epcregister.com/reportSearchAddressTerms.html) there’s also a data set here: [London domestic efficiency by boroughs](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/domestic-energy-efficiency-ratings-borough)
- [microgeneration](https://www.microgenerationcertification.org/) quality certification supported by BEIS
- [stroma certification](https://www.stroma.com/certification/) for epc, gas, etc...
- [BREEAM](https://www.breeam.com/) world’s leading sustainability assessment method + certification for masterplanning projects, infrastructure and buildings.
